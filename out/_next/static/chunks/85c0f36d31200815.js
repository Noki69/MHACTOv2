But it was the chicharon — deep-fried pork rind — that would put Bocaue on the national food map. In the mid-1900s, home-based chicharon makers along the main highway began selling to passing travelers. Word spread, and by the 1970s and '80s, an entire chicharon industry flourished, with families perfecting recipes handed down across generations. The secret lies in a slow double-fry process and careful seasoning that gives Bocaue chicharon its trademark airy crunch and rich flavor.

The river also attracted Spanish missionaries, who established the parish along its banks. Over time, the riverbanks became the natural gathering place for the community — children played by the water, women washed clothes on the stones, and the annual pagoda procession turned the river into a floating cathedral. In recent years, local government initiatives have beautified sections of the riverbank with walking paths, benches, and native plantings, making it an accessible nature walk where visitors can enjoy birdwatching, photography, and the peaceful sound of flowing water.

The craft was passed from parent to child in backyard workshops, where raw materials like potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal were carefully measured and packed by hand. Fireworks from Bocaue became the go-to choice for town fiestas, New Year celebrations, and national holidays across the country. Alongside pyrotechnics, local artisans also produced intricate parol (Christmas lanterns), woven bamboo goods, and hand-painted signage.

For over two centuries, the plaza has been the stage for everything: religious processions, political rallies, market days, band concerts, and children's games. Ancient acacia and mango trees provide shade, and a central gazebo (kiosko) has hosted countless community events. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the plaza saw gatherings of Katipuneros who would go on to fight for independence. During the American and Japanese occupations, it served as both a refuge and a battleground.
