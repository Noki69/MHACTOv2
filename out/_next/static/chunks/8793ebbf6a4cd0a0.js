By the mid-1700s, a stone church was erected under the patronage of St. Martin of Tours, the beloved 4th-century bishop known for sharing his cloak with a beggar. The church survived earthquakes, typhoons, and the devastation of World War II. Its Baroque façade, hand-carved retablos, and centuries-old wooden santos narrate a living history of devotion.

Believing it to be miraculous, the townspeople enshrined it and began an annual fluvial procession in its honor. Over the centuries, devotees would build an ornate pagoda — a towering bamboo-and-cloth float — and place the Holy Cross atop it, then row it along the river accompanied by hundreds of boats, music, and prayers. The festival was not without tragedy: in 1993, a pagoda collapsed mid-river, claiming many lives. Rather than abandon the tradition, Bocaueños rebuilt with greater resolve, implementing safety reforms while preserving the spiritual heart of the celebration.

The town's culinary legacy stretches back to the pre-colonial era, when indigenous communities along the river prepared rice cakes (kakanin) as offerings during harvest festivals. Suman wrapped in banana leaves, bibingka baked over charcoal, and colorful puto became staples of every celebration. But it was the chicharon — deep-fried pork rind — that would put Bocaue on the national food map. In the mid-1900s, home-based chicharon makers along the main highway began selling to passing travelers. Word spread, and by the 1970s and '80s, an entire chicharon industry flourished, with families perfecting recipes handed down across generations. The secret lies in a slow double-fry process and careful seasoning that gives Bocaue chicharon its trademark airy crunch and rich flavor.

The river also attracted Spanish missionaries, who established the parish along its banks. Over time, the riverbanks became the natural gathering place for the community — children played by the water, women washed clothes on the stones, and the annual pagoda procession turned the river into a floating cathedral. In recent years, local government initiatives have beautified sections of the riverbank with walking paths, benches, and native plantings, making it an accessible nature walk where visitors can enjoy birdwatching, photography, and the peaceful sound of flowing water.

By the late 1800s, Bocaue families had mastered the art of creating elaborate fireworks — from simple sparklers to towering cascadas and thundering aerial shells. The craft was passed from parent to child in backyard workshops, where raw materials like potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal were carefully measured and packed by hand. Fireworks from Bocaue became the go-to choice for town fiestas, New Year celebrations, and national holidays across the country. Alongside pyrotechnics, local artisans also produced intricate parol (Christmas lanterns), woven bamboo goods, and hand-painted signage.

The Bocaue Old Town Plaza was laid out in the 1700s following the Leyes de Indias (Laws of the Indies), which mandated that town centers feature a rectangular open space flanked by the church, the municipal hall, and prominent residences. For over two centuries, the plaza has been the stage for everything: religious processions, political rallies, market days, band concerts, and children's games. Ancient acacia and mango trees provide shade, and a central gazebo (kiosko) has hosted countless community events. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the plaza saw gatherings of Katipuneros who would go on to fight for independence. During the American and Japanese occupations, it served as both a refuge and a battleground.
